# 🔐 CSE-478: Introduction to Computer Security Lab  
## 🧩 Lab 2 — Attacking Classic Crypto Systems (Group A)

### 🎯 **Objective**
The goal of this lab is to **attack and break classic cryptographic systems** (Caesar Cipher and Substitution Cipher).  
By doing so, we demonstrate the **weaknesses of traditional encryption methods** and learn how cryptanalysis techniques exploit them.

---

## 🧠 **Lab Overview**
In this lab, we will:
- Write programs to **decrypt ciphers** without knowing the key.
- Apply **brute-force search** for Caesar Cipher.
- Use **frequency analysis** for Substitution Cipher.
- Analyze which cipher was easier to break and explain why.
